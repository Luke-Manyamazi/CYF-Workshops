Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer

b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`

{YOUR ANSWERS HERE}

a) result1 will return a value.
b) result2 will return an output to the console.
c) adThey produce the same result, but one only prints to the screen and the other just returns.
